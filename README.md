Synacor challenge
=================

This repository contains 2 version of the OSCONN Synacor challenge.
Those ones I found in the open internet. It looks like those are just a different versions of the same challenge, but I did not know which one works, so I decided to save both of them. 

Hence there are two directories var1 and var2 with different version of the challenge binaries. 

The rules of the challenge are described in the file called *arch-spec* 
The binary program is a data file of approximately 60kb size called *challenge.bin*. 

The goal is to collect all the codes, meanwhile solving quizes, mazes, puzzles, and other kinds of programming (and not only) challenges. 

Good luck, with solving it your way!
